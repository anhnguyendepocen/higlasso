# higlasso

## Installation
`higlasso` can be installed via Github using `devtools`

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("umich-cphds/higlasso")
```
You'll need a working C++11 compiler, which can obtained by installing Xcode on
MacOS, and RTools on Windows.
## Example

This is a very rough example on how to run higlasso

```{r, eval=F}
library(higlasso)

X <- as.matrix(higlasso.df[, paste0("V", 1:10)])

Y <- higlasso.df$Y

Z <- matrix(1, nrow(X))

# This can take a bit of time
higlasso.fit <- higlasso(Y, X, Z)
```
