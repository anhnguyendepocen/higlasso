Description:
    Environmental health studies are increasingly measuring multiple pollutants
    to characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure mixtures.
    However, the underlying dose-response relationship between toxicants and
    health outcomes of interest may be highly nonlinear, with possible
    nonlinear interaction effects. Hierarchical integrative group LASSO
    (HiGLASSO) is a general shrinkage and selection framework to identify
    noteworthy nonlinear main and interaction effects in the presence of
    group structures among a set of exposures.
