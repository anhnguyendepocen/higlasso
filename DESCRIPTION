Description:
    Environmental health studies are increasingly measuring multiple pollutants
    to  characterize the joint health effects attributable to exposure mixtures.
    However, the underlying dose-response relation- ship between toxicants and
    health outcomes of interest may be highly nonlinear, with possible nonlinear
    interaction effects. We present hierarchical integrative group LASSO
    (HiGLASSO), a general shrinkage and selection framework to identify
    noteworthy nonlinear main and interaction. HiGLASSO is broadly applicable
    for studying potential nonlinear main and interaction effects in the
    presence of group structures among a set of exposures.
